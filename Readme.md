This project started as a way to explore and model data related to the Dutch language.
A month ago I began studying Dutch. Very quickly I felt overwhelmed by
all the exceptions in the rules—especially with the articles het and de. 
It seemed to me that the exception is the rule. So I thought:
why not use data to uncover patterns myself? Maybe I could find shortcuts or
at least a clearer picture. When I studied Mandarin Chinese in the past, grammar was simple,
but tones drove me mad. 
I tried a similar approach with the Mandarin Chinese tones. 
Now I’m doing the same for Dutch. Hopefully it won’t just help me, 
but also anyone else learning the language. Sharing is multiplying.

The main and most important part of it is the Semantic Embeddings page(Streamlit app).
